# Production dependencies for MCP Audit
#
# MCP Audit has zero required dependencies for Python 3.11+
# (uses built-in tomllib for TOML parsing)
#
# For Python 3.8-3.10, the toml package is optional but recommended
# for pricing configuration support. Without it, mcp-audit.toml
# won't be loaded and cost calculations will return 0.

# Optional: TOML parsing for Python 3.8-3.10
# Uncomment if using Python 3.8-3.10 and want pricing configuration
# toml>=0.10.2
