# Roadmap

This document outlines the planned development direction for MCP Audit. For completed features, see the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

## Current Status

**Version**: v0.6.0
**Stage**: Multi-Model Intelligence — Per-Model Tracking, Dynamic Pricing, Schema v1.6.0

MCP Audit provides stable support for Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Gemini CLI. v0.6.0 introduces multi-model per-session tracking, dynamic pricing via LiteLLM API, and the foundation for static cost tracking.

---

## ✅ v0.5.0 — Insight Layer (Released)

**Theme:** "See What's Wrong"

The foundation for efficiency insights and AI-assisted analysis.

- ✅ **Smell Engine MVP** — Detect 5 efficiency patterns: HIGH_VARIANCE, TOP_CONSUMER, HIGH_MCP_SHARE, CHATTY, LOW_CACHE_HIT
- ✅ **Zombie Tool Detection** — Identify MCP tools defined but never called
- ✅ **Data Quality System** — Accuracy labels: exact/estimated/calls-only
- ✅ **AI Prompt Export MVP** — `mcp-audit export ai-prompt` for AI analysis
- ✅ **Schema v1.5.0** — `smells`, `data_quality`, `zombie_tools` blocks

**Success Metrics:**
- ✅ Users can identify inefficient MCP usage patterns
- ✅ AI assistants can consume session data for analysis
- ✅ Clear accuracy labeling for all metrics

## ✅ v0.6.0 — Multi-Model Intelligence (Released)

**Theme:** "Track Everything"

Multi-model tracking and dynamic pricing infrastructure.

- ✅ **Multi-Model Tracking** — Per-model tokens/costs when switching models mid-session
- ✅ **Dynamic Pricing** — LiteLLM pricing API (2,000+ models) with 24h caching and TOML fallback
- ✅ **Static Cost Foundation** — Infrastructure for MCP schema "context tax" (full impl deferred)
- ✅ **Schema v1.6.0** — `models_used`, `model_usage`, `pricing_source` blocks

**Note:** Ollama CLI Adapter moved to v0.6.1 (requires API proxy approach).

**Success Metrics:**
- ✅ Sessions with model switches show per-model breakdown
- ✅ Pricing stays current via LiteLLM API
- ✅ 3 platforms supported: Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI
