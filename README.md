## 💡 Why mcp-audit?

**mcp-audit** is a real-time session tracker that shows you which MCP tools are being called, with full per-tool token attribution on Claude Code and call-count tracking across all platforms. Whether you're building MCP servers or using them daily, mcp-audit gives you the data you need to investigate and fix context bloat & high token usage at the source.

No other tool provides this level of MCP-specific visibility. It starts with the data.

### How mcp-audit Compares

#### vs. [ccusage](https://github.com/ryoppippi/ccusage) ⭐ 9K+

ccusage is a fantastic **historical analyzer**—it tracks your Claude Code usage over time (daily, monthly, all-time reports). Use it to understand long-term spending trends and budget planning.

| | ccusage | mcp-audit ✓ |
|---|---------|:------------|
| **Focus** | Historical trends | ✅ Real-time sessions |
| **Question answered** | "What did I spend this month?" | ✅ "What's eating my context *right now*?" |
| **Granularity** | Session/day/month totals | ✅ Per-MCP-server, per-tool breakdown¹ |
| **Best for** | Cost tracking over time | ✅ Investigating specific tool issues |

#### vs. [Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor](https://github.com/Maciek-roboblog/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor) ⭐ 5.8K+

Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor is a great **session limit tracker**—it predicts when you'll hit your token limit and shows burn rate. Use it to manage your session pacing.

| | Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor | mcp-audit ✓ |
|---|---------------------------|:------------|
| **Focus** | Session limits & predictions | ✅ MCP tool analysis |
| **Question answered** | "Will I run out of tokens?" | ✅ "Which MCP tool is causing this?" |
| **Granularity** | Total session tokens | ✅ Per-server, per-tool breakdown¹ |
| **Best for** | Session pacing | ✅ Debugging MCP tool efficiency |

> ¹ Per-tool token breakdown requires Claude Code. Codex CLI and Gemini CLI provide call counts with session-level token totals.

#### Why mcp-audit for MCP Tool Development

If you're **building or optimizing MCP servers**, mcp-audit is the only tool that:

- 🔍 **Breaks down tokens per MCP tool** — See exactly which tools bloat context (Claude Code)
- 📌 **Pins specific servers** — Monitor your server while you develop
- 🔄 **Detects duplicates** — Find redundant tool calls automatically
- 📊 **Tracks cache efficiency** — Understand if caching helps or hurts
- 🚨 **Flags anomalies** — Get warnings for high-variance patterns
- 📈 **Counts all tool calls** — Track MCP usage across all platforms

> [!TIP]
> **Use them together**: ccusage for monthly cost trends, Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor for session pacing, and mcp-audit for MCP tool-level investigation.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Track a Session

```bash
# Track Claude Code session
mcp-audit collect --platform claude-code

# Track Codex CLI session
mcp-audit collect --platform codex-cli

# Track Gemini CLI session
mcp-audit collect --platform gemini-cli
```

Sessions are automatically saved to `~/.mcp-audit/sessions/`.

### 2. Generate a Report

```bash
# View summary of all sessions
mcp-audit report ~/.mcp-audit/sessions/

# Export detailed CSV
mcp-audit report ~/.mcp-audit/sessions/ --format csv --output report.csv

# Generate markdown report
mcp-audit report ~/.mcp-audit/sessions/ --format markdown --output report.md
```

### 3. Review Results

mcp__brave-search__web               45   123,456       2,743
mcp__zen__chat                       89    98,765       1,109

Estimated Total Cost: $2.34 (across 15 sessions)
```

> Per-tool token breakdown shown above is from Claude Code sessions. Codex CLI and Gemini CLI reports show call counts with session-level totals.

### Typical Session

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start tracking before your Claude Code session
mcp-audit collect --platform claude-code

# Terminal 2: Work normally in Claude Code
# (TUI shows tokens accumulating in real-time as you use MCP tools)

# When done, press Ctrl+C in Terminal 1
# Session auto-saved to ~/.mcp-audit/sessions/
```

## 🖥️ Platform Support

| Platform | Status | Token Tracking | What You Get |
|----------|--------|----------------|--------------|
| Claude Code | **Stable** | Full (per-tool) | Per-tool token attribution, cache analysis |
| Codex CLI | **Stable** | Session-level | Call counts, session costs, reasoning tokens² |
| Gemini CLI | **Stable** | Session-level | Call counts, session costs, reasoning tokens² |
| Ollama CLI | *Coming Soon* | Time-based | Duration tracking (no token costs locally) |

> **Note**: Per-tool token attribution is a Claude Code exclusive. Codex CLI and Gemini CLI provide accurate session totals with tool call counts—still unique visibility no other tool offers.
>
> ² Reasoning tokens (thinking/chain-of-thought) tracked separately for o-series (Codex) and Gemini 2.0+ models.

<details>

## ✨ Feature Details

### ⚡ Real-Time TUI

Watch tokens flow as you work—no manual tracking:

```
MCP Audit v0.3.14
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Project: my-project │ Claude Opus 4.5 │ 12m 34s

Tokens
  Input: 45,231 │ Output: 12,543 │ Cache: 125K (93%)
  Cost: $0.12 │ Cache Savings: $0.89

MCP Servers & Tools (42 calls)
  zen (28 calls, 234K tokens)
    thinkdeep ........ 8 calls, 156K tokens
    chat ............. 15 calls, 45K tokens
  brave-search (14 calls, 89K tokens)
    brave_web_search . 14 calls, 89K tokens
```

> The TUI above shows Claude Code output with full per-tool token attribution. On Codex CLI and Gemini CLI, token columns show call counts only (per-tool tokens are a platform limitation).

**Investigating context bloat?** Pin your MCP server to monitor it closely during development:

```bash
mcp-audit collect --platform claude-code --pin-server myserver
```

### 📊 Cross-Session Analysis

Aggregate insights across all your sessions:

```bash
mcp-audit report ~/.mcp-audit/sessions/ --aggregate
```

- Top expensive tools by total tokens
- Most frequently called tools
- Anomaly detection (high variance, duplicates)
- Per-server cost breakdowns

### 🔍 Duplicate Detection

Spot wasted tokens from redundant tool calls:

```json
{
  "redundancy_analysis": {
    "duplicate_calls": 3,
    "potential_savings": 15234
  }
}
```

### 🗄️ Cache Analysis

Understand whether caching is helping or hurting. Session logs include AI-readable insights:

```json
{
  "cache_analysis": {
    "status": "efficient",
    "summary": "Good cache reuse (85% efficiency). Savings: $0.89",
    "top_cache_creators": [{"tool": "mcp__zen__thinkdeep", "pct": 45}],
    "recommendation": "Cache is working well for this session."
  }
}
```

### 🔒 Privacy-First

- **No prompts stored** - Only token counts and tool names
- **Local-only** - All data stays on your machine
- **Redaction hooks** - Customize what gets logged

## ❓ FAQ

<details open>
<summary><strong>Does mcp-audit work with resumed/continued sessions?</strong></summary>
<br>

**Yes.** If you start mcp-audit and then resume a Claude Code session from yesterday, it will track all new activity from that point forward. Claude Code appends new events to the existing session file, and mcp-audit monitors for new content regardless of when the session originally started.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What if I start mcp-audit after Claude Code is already running?</strong></summary>
<br>

**It works, but you'll only capture activity from that point forward.** When mcp-audit starts, it records the current position in all session files. Any new events written after that point are tracked. Events that occurred before you started mcp-audit are not captured.

> [!TIP]
> Start mcp-audit first, then start or resume your Claude Code session.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does mcp-audit track historical data or only new activity?</strong></summary>
<br>

**Only new activity.** mcp-audit is designed for real-time monitoring. It deliberately skips historical data to avoid:
- Re-processing old sessions you've already analyzed
- Inflating token counts with past activity
- Confusion about what happened "this session" vs "last week"

If you need to analyze historical sessions, use `mcp-audit report` on previously saved session files.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I track multiple Claude Code windows or projects?</strong></summary>
<br>

**Yes, but each requires its own mcp-audit instance.** Each Claude Code project has its own session file in `~/.claude/projects/`. If you're working in multiple directories simultaneously:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Track project A
cd ~/projects/project-a
mcp-audit collect --platform claude-code

# Terminal 2: Track project B
cd ~/projects/project-b
mcp-audit collect --platform claude-code
```

Each mcp-audit instance monitors the session files for its working directory.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why am I seeing 0 tokens or no activity?</strong></summary>
<br>

Common causes:

1. **Started mcp-audit after Claude Code** - Only new activity is tracked. Try making a request in Claude Code after starting mcp-audit.

2. **Wrong directory** - mcp-audit looks for session files based on your working directory. Make sure you're in the same directory as your Claude Code session.

3. **No MCP tools used** - mcp-audit tracks MCP server tools (like `mcp__zen__chat`). Built-in tools (Read, Write, Bash) are tracked separately. If you're not using MCP tools, you'll see low/zero MCP activity.

4. **Session file not found** - Check that Claude Code has created a session file:
   ```bash
   ls ~/.claude/projects/
   ```

5. **Platform limitation (Codex/Gemini)** - Codex CLI and Gemini CLI don't provide per-tool token attribution. You'll see accurate session totals and call counts, but individual tool token columns will show 0. This is expected behavior, not a bug.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Where is my data stored? Is it sent anywhere?</strong></summary>
<br>

**All data stays on your machine.** mcp-audit is completely local:

- Session data: `~/.mcp-audit/sessions/`
- Configuration: `~/.mcp-audit/mcp-audit.toml`
- No network requests, no telemetry, no cloud sync

Only token counts and tool names are logged—**prompts and responses are never stored**.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I stop tracking without losing data?</strong></summary>
<br>

**Press Ctrl+C.** mcp-audit handles interrupts gracefully:

1. Catches the interrupt signal
2. Completes the session summary
3. Writes all data to disk
4. Exits cleanly

You'll see a confirmation message:
```
Session saved to: ~/.mcp-audit/sessions/2025-12-02/mcp-audit-2025-12-02T14-30-45.json
```

> [!WARNING]
> Avoid `kill -9` or force-quitting the terminal, which may result in incomplete session data.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I track multiple platforms at the same time?</strong></summary>
<br>

**Yes.** Run separate mcp-audit instances for each platform:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Track Claude Code
mcp-audit collect --platform claude-code

# Terminal 2: Track Codex CLI
mcp-audit collect --platform codex-cli
```

Sessions are organized by date in `~/.mcp-audit/sessions/`.
