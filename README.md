## 👥 Who Is This For?

| 🛠️ **The Builder** | 💻 **The Vibecoder** |
|:---|:---|
| *"Is my MCP server (or the one I downloaded) too heavy?"* | *"Why did my CLI Agent auto-compact so quickly?"* |
| You build MCP servers and want visibility into token consumption patterns. | You use Cursor/Claude daily and hit context limits without knowing why. |
| **You need:** Per-tool token breakdown, usage trends. | **You need:** Real-time cost tracking, session telemetry. |

## 🚀 What MCP Audit Does (At a Glance)

A real-time MCP token profiler designed to help you understand exactly where your tokens are going — and why.

### 🔎 Token Profiling
- Tracks real-time token usage across Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Gemini CLI
- Breaks down usage by server, tool, and individual call

### 🧠 Problem Detection
- Flags context bloat and schema overhead ("context tax")
- Detects early auto-compaction triggers
- Highlights payload spikes and chatty tools
- **Smell Detection:** 5 efficiency anti-patterns (HIGH_VARIANCE, CHATTY, etc.)
- **Zombie Tools:** Finds unused MCP tools wasting schema tokens

### 📊 Analysis & Reporting
- Generates post-session summaries for deeper optimisation
- Supports multi-session comparisons (aggregation mode)
- **AI Export:** Export sessions for AI assistant analysis
- **Data Quality:** Clear accuracy labels (exact/estimated/calls-only)

### 🔒 Privacy & Integration

- No proxies, no interception, no cloud uploads — all data stays local
- Works alongside existing agent workflows with zero setup overhead

---

## ❓ MCP Problems MCP Audit Helps Solve

**"Why is my MCP server using so many tokens?"**

Large `list_tools` schemas and verbose tool outputs add a hidden context tax.
MCP Audit reveals exactly where that cost comes from.

**"Why does Claude Code keep auto-compacting?"**

Auto-compaction usually triggers when tool schemas or outputs are too large.
MCP Audit shows the exact schema + tool calls contributing to early compaction.

**"Which MCP tools are the most expensive?"**

The TUI highlights per-tool token usage, spikes, and trends in real time.

**"How do I reduce token costs in multi-step agent workflows?"**

Use the post-session reports to identify inefficient tool patterns, chatty tools, and large payloads.

---

### 🛡️ How It Works (Safe & Passive)

`mcp-audit` is a **passive observer**. It watches your local session logs and artifacts in real-time.
* **No Proxies:** It does not intercept your network traffic or API calls.
* **No Latency:** It runs as a sidecar process, adding zero overhead to your agent.
* **Local Only & Private:** All data remains on your machine.
* **Telemetry Only:** Provides signals and metrics — you (or your AI) decide what to do with them.

**Note:** MCP Audit is telemetry-only — no recommendations or optimizations are performed automatically.
Use the AI export command (`mcp-audit export ai-prompt`) to analyze your results with your preferred AI CLI.

MCP Audit helps you understand *why* your MCP tools behave the way they do—whether it's high token usage, slow agent performance, or unexpected context growth.
It turns raw MCP telemetry into actionable insights you can use to optimise your agent workflows.

---

## 🚀 What's New (v0.5.0)

- **Smell Detection Engine:** Automatically detect 5 efficiency anti-patterns: `HIGH_VARIANCE`, `TOP_CONSUMER`, `HIGH_MCP_SHARE`, `CHATTY`, and `LOW_CACHE_HIT`.
- **AI Prompt Export:** Export session data for AI analysis with `mcp-audit export ai-prompt` (markdown and JSON formats).
- **Zombie Tool Detection:** Identify MCP tools defined but never called (wasting schema tokens).
- **Data Quality Indicators:** Clear accuracy labels (`exact`/`estimated`/`calls-only`) with confidence scores.
- **Schema v1.5.0:** New `smells`, `zombie_tools`, and `data_quality` blocks in session logs.

See the [Changelog](https://github.com/littlebearapps/mcp-audit/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for full version history.

## 🔍 What to Look For (The "Audit")

Once you're running `mcp-audit`, watch for these common patterns in your telemetry:

1. **The "Context Tax" (High Initial Load):**
   - *Signal:* Your session starts with 10k+ tokens before you type a word.
   - *What this might indicate:* Large `list_tools` schemas can increase context usage on each turn (detailed telemetry coming in v0.6.0+).

2. **The "Payload Spike" (Unexpected Cost):**
   - *Signal:* A single tool call consumes far more tokens than expected.
   - *What this might indicate:* Large file reads or verbose API responses.

3. **The "Zombie Tool":**
   - *Signal:* A tool appears in your schema but is never called.
   - *What this might indicate:* Unused tools consuming schema tokens on every turn.
   - *Detection:* Configure known tools in `mcp-audit.toml` and MCP Audit will flag unused ones.

4. **The "Auto-Compaction Trigger"** (Early Context Collapse):
   - *Signal:* Claude Code or Codex CLI compacts the conversation unexpectedly early.
   - *What this might indicate:* High schema weight or repeated inclusion of large payloads.
   - *How MCP Audit helps:* Identifies which MCP server or MCP tool is pushing the session over the threshold.

## 🎮 Quick Start

### 1. Start Tracking

Open a separate terminal window and run (see [Platform Guides](#-documentation) for detailed setup):

```bash
# Auto-detects your platform (or specify with --platform)
mcp-audit collect --platform claude-code
mcp-audit collect --platform codex-cli
mcp-audit collect --platform gemini-cli
```

### 2. Work Normally

Go back to your agent (Claude Code, Codex CLI, or Gemini CLI) and start working. The MCP Audit TUI updates in real-time as you use tools.

> **TUI runs automatically.** Other display options: `--quiet` (logs only), `--plain` (CI/pipelines), `--no-logs` (display only).

### 3. Analyze Later

Generate a post-mortem report to see where the money went:

```bash
# See the top 10 most expensive tools
mcp-audit report ~/.mcp-audit/sessions/ --top-n 10

# Session logs are stored by default in ~/.mcp-audit/sessions/
```

Now that you're collecting telemetry, read [What to Look For](#-what-to-look-for-the-audit) to understand the signals that indicate context bloat, expensive tools, and auto-compaction risks.

## 🧠 Why Developers Use MCP Audit

MCP tools and servers often generate hidden token overhead—from schema size, payload spikes, and inefficient tool patterns.
These issues cause:

- **Early auto-compaction** — sessions end prematurely
- **Slow agent performance** — large contexts increase latency
- **Unexpected cost increases** — tokens add up faster than expected
- **Misleading debug logs** — hard to trace the real source of bloat
- **Context window exhaustion** — hitting limits before finishing work

MCP Audit exposes these hidden costs and helps you build faster, cheaper, more predictable MCP workflows.

## ❓ Usage & Support FAQ

<details open>
<summary><strong>How accurate is token estimation for Codex CLI and Gemini CLI?</strong></summary>

<br>

**Very accurate.** In v0.4.0, we use the same tokenizers as the underlying models:

- **Codex CLI (OpenAI):** Uses `tiktoken` with the `o200k_base` encoding — the same tokenizer OpenAI uses. Session-level accuracy is **99%+**.
- **Gemini CLI (Google):** Uses the official `Gemma` tokenizer (via `mcp-audit tokenizer download`). Session-level accuracy is **100%**. Without it, we fall back to `tiktoken` at ~95% accuracy.

**Per-tool token estimates** are also highly accurate in most cases, though platforms don't provide native per-tool attribution (only Claude Code does).

Claude Code provides native token counts directly from Anthropic's servers, so no estimation is needed there.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why am I seeing 0 tokens or no activity?</strong></summary>

<br>

1. **Started MCP Audit after the agent** — Only new activity is tracked. Start `mcp-audit` first, then your agent.
2. **Wrong directory** — MCP Audit looks for session files based on your current working directory.
3. **No MCP tools used yet** — Built-in tools (Read, Write, Bash) are tracked separately. Try using an MCP tool.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Where is my data stored?</strong></summary>

<br>

**All data stays on your machine:**
- Session data: `~/.mcp-audit/sessions/`
- Configuration: `~/.mcp-audit/mcp-audit.toml`
- No network requests, no telemetry

Only token counts and tool names are logged—**prompts and responses are never stored**.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can MCP Audit help diagnose context bloat in MCP servers?</strong></summary>

<br>

Yes. MCP Audit tracks schema weight, per-tool usage, and payload spikes that contribute to context bloat in Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Gemini CLI. It helps you understand why your agent is using so many tokens and where optimisation will have the biggest impact.
