|----------|---------|--------------|
| Know if your tools are efficient | **Per-tool token metrics** | See exact token consumption per tool call |
| Compare tool versions | **Cross-session analysis** | Track improvements across development cycles |
| Find bloated tools | **Top expensive tools ranking** | Instantly identify the worst offenders |
| Optimize cache behavior | **Cache analysis with AI-readable breakdown** | See which tools drive cache creation vs reuse |
| Catch redundant API patterns | **Duplicate detection** | Find repeated identical calls automatically |
| Ship with confidence | **Anomaly detection** | Get warnings for high-variance or high-frequency patterns |
| Investigate context bloat | **Server pinning** | Pin your server to monitor it closely during development |

### Key Features for Developers

- Benchmark against expected performance

**2. Cache Analysis (AI-Readable)**
```json
{
  "cache_analysis": {
    "status": "inefficient",
    "top_cache_creators": [{"tool": "mcp__myserver__fetch", "tokens": 50000, "pct": 80}],
    "recommendation": "Consider batching related queries to reuse cached context."
  }
}
```
- Understand cache creation vs read patterns

    "potential_savings": 15234,
    "details": [{"tool": "mcp__myserver__search", "count": 2, "tokens": 8765}]
  }
}
```
- Find identical tool calls that could be cached
- Quantify potential token savings
- Improve tool design to avoid redundancy

**4. Cross-Session Trend Analysis**
```bash
mcp-audit report ~/.mcp-audit/sessions/ --format csv --output analysis.csv
```
- Track optimization progress over time
- Compare before/after metrics
- Export to spreadsheet for deeper analysis

### Developer Workflow

```bash
# 1. Track while developing
mcp-audit collect --platform claude-code --pin-server myserver

# 2. Work with your MCP tools
# (Real-time TUI shows per-tool metrics)

# 3. Review session results
mcp-audit report ~/.mcp-audit/sessions/

# 4. Iterate and improve
# (Track new sessions to verify optimizations)
```

## Platform-Specific Benefits

### Claude Code Users

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| Cache tracking | Understand Anthropic's cache efficiency |
| Context limit visibility | Know when you're approaching limits |
| Model detection | See which Claude model is being used |
| Session file monitoring | Zero-config automatic tracking |
| Built-in tool summary | Track Bash, Read, Edit, Glob usage in session files |

**Pain Point Addressed**: "Why did I hit the context limit?"

### Codex CLI Users

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| Direct cost tracking | Know exactly what you're paying |
| OpenAI model pricing | Accurate cost estimates |
| Cross-platform normalization | Same analysis format as Claude Code |
| Real-time monitoring | Watch costs accumulate |
| Reasoning token tracking | See thinking tokens for o-series models (v1.3.0) |
| Built-in tool call counts | Track shell, read_file, apply_patch, etc. |

**Pain Point Addressed**: "What am I actually spending on Codex?"

**Note**: Codex CLI provides turn-level tokens only. Built-in tool call counts are tracked but per-tool token attribution is not available from the platform. Reasoning tokens (from o1, o3 models) are tracked separately from output tokens.

### Gemini CLI Users

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| Native session parsing | No OTEL setup required |
| Reasoning token tracking | See thinking/reasoning costs separately (v1.3.0) |
| Google model pricing | Accurate cost estimates |
| Tool call detection | Track MCP and built-in tool usage |
| Built-in tool call counts | Track read_file, list_directory, etc. |

**Pain Point Addressed**: "How does Gemini CLI compare to alternatives?"

**Note**: Gemini CLI provides message-level tokens only. Built-in tool call counts are tracked but per-tool token attribution is not available from the platform. Reasoning tokens (Gemini's `thoughts` field) are tracked separately from output tokens.

## mcp-audit vs ccusage

| Tool | Focus | Use Case |
|------|-------|----------|
| [ccusage](https://github.com/ryoppippi/ccusage) | Historical trends | "What did I spend this month?" |
| mcp-audit | Session tracking | "What's eating context right now?" |

ccusage is a historical analyzer—it tracks long-term usage trends (daily, monthly, all-time). mcp-audit is a **session tracker**—real-time visibility into what's happening *right now*, with per-tool granularity to investigate context bloat & high token usage as it happens.
