"""
Zombie Tool Detector - Identifies MCP tools defined but never called.

A "zombie tool" is an MCP tool that:
- Appears in the server's tool schema
- Was never called during the session
- Contributes to context overhead without providing value

This module provides detection based on:
1. User-configured known tools in mcp-audit.toml
2. Tools discovered from previous sessions (future enhancement)
